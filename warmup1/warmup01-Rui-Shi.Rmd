## Recipe
- 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons (285 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (110 grams) coconut oil, warmed just enough to liquefy
- 1 1/2 cups full- or low-fat coconut milk (see Note)
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) plain vinegar


### Special tools
no sprcial tools

### Steps
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of 9-inch round cake pan with a fitted round of parchment paper and coat the bottoms and sides with nonstick cooking spray.
Whisk together flour, baking soda, salt and granulated sugar in the bottom of a large mixing bowl. Add coconut oil, coconut milk, and vinegar and whisk until batter is smooth.

2. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes [updated to note: it¡¯s sounding in the comments like it¡¯s taking some people a bit longer ¡ª it¡¯s not done until the center is set, even if it¡¯s longer than it took me], or until the top is springy and a tester inserted in the center comes out batter-free. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then cut around it with a knife to ensure it is loosened and flip it out onto a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way.

3. If you wish to make a glaze: Whisk together 3/4 cup powdered sugar with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the leftover coconut milk, adding a little at a time, until it is smooth but not too runny. Add a pinch of salt, if you wish. Once cake is fully cool, spread over the top of the cake and smooth to the edges with a knife or small offset spatula, where it will find its way down the sides decoratively on its own. I added some white confetti sprinkles, but toasted coconut chips would be nice here too.

##Euclidean distance

**Definition**
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$d(\textbf{p},\textbf{q}) = d(\textbf{q,p}) = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i-p_i)^2}$$     (1)




The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\left\|p\right\|=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+...+p_n^2}= \sqrt{\textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{q}}	$$,


where the last expression involves the dot product.
